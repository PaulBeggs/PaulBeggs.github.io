## Grid System

1. Bootstrap’s grid columns are represented by 12 vertical bars. The boxes represent HTML elements.

2. The words “container”, “jumbotron”, “col-sm-6” and “col-sm-3” refer to Bootstrap classes.

3. The element with class “jumbotron” spans the entire width of the webpage, beyond the borders of the grid.

4. Elements inside the second “container”, such as “col-sm-6” and “col-sm-3” are contained within the grid columns.

5. Elements labeled “col-sm-3” take up three grid columns; elements labeled “col-sm-6” take up six grid columns.
